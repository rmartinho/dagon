Standard fare roguelike with a time travelling mechanic. Single player, randomly-generated content, no saving.

All previous state information is saved except for player information.

The player has a time travelling ability that I won't bother balancing because fun. Said ability allows the player to move back into any previous state.

If enough time left, forked timestreams?
